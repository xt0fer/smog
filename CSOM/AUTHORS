This file lists all people who have contributed to the CSOM VM.

The precursor of CSOM was SOM, which was originally implemented in Java at the
University of Aarhus (Denmark) in 2001/2002. The implementation of SOM was done
by Jakob Roland Andersen, Kasper Verdich Lund, Lars Bak, Mads Torgersen, and
Ulrik Pagh Schultz. They also wrote the original versions of the SOM Smalltalk
libraries, test suites, and benchmarks, that are (in extended versions) bundled
with CSOM.

SOM was used by Michael Haupt in courses on virtual machines at Lancaster
University and Technische Universitaet Darmstadt (Germany) in VM courses in
2006. During that time, some changes were applied to SOM by Michael Haupt and
Sebastian Kanthak.

CSOM, the C port of SOM, was realised at the Hasso Plattner Institute (Potsdam,
Germany) in 2006/7 by Michael Haupt and Tobias Pape. Stefan Marr and Jan-Arne
Sobania have contributed a performance patch. Stefan Marr also contributed the Snake game.
