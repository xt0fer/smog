CSOM - The Simple Object Machine implemented in C
=================================================

Introduction
------------

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was also used for teaching.

Currently, implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), and
Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple SOM Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains a plain C implementation of SOM, including an
implementation of the SOM standard library and a number of examples. Please see
the [main project page][SOMst] for links to the VM implementations.


CSOM can be built with Make:

    $ make

Afterwards, the tests can be executed with:

    ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk TestSuite/TestHarness.som
   
A simple Hello World program is executed with:

    ./som.sh -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som

The debug version of CSOM can be built using the `debug` target:

    $ make debug

Additional documentation, detailing for instance the object model and how to
implement primitives, is available in the `doc` folder.

WebAssembly CSOM
----------------

CSOM can be compiled using GCC, Clang, but also emscripten.
With emscripten, it can run on Node.js as follows:

 - install [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) and set it up for compilation.
   One easy way is using Docker, as in the .travis.yml. Another is with [emsdk](https://github.com/juj/emsdk/)
 - build with: `make emscripten`
 - run with: `node CSOM.js -cp Smalltalk Examples/Hello.som`
